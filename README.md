## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD. DO NOT GENERATE RANDOM ROLLS. THE USER INPUTS THE ROLLS.**


### Optional Extras

In any order you like:

* Create a nice interactive animated interface with jQuery.
* Set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to run your tests. - Am still trying to get this working.
* Add [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to your codebase and make your code conform. - Think i managed to get this installed and working when i run the npx eslint src/"myfile".js commands I get error related to class names not being defined and or used. Not 100% sure if it is installed correctly/ 

### Perfect Game

A Perfect Game is when the player rolls 12 strikes (10 regular strikes and 2 strikes for the bonus in the 10th frame). The Perfect Game scores 300 points.

In the image below you can find some score examples.
